mergesort.c

Single threaded recursive implementation of merge sort.  Merging is done by
copying the segments of the array to be merged, as opposed to merging in place.

mergesort-parallel.c

Processed based recursive impelmentation of merge sort, using processes.
Not merging in place.  Implemented like a fork bomb.

mergesort-pool.c

Processed based recursive impelmentation of merge sort, using processes.
Not merging in place.  Implemented limiting the degree of parallelism.
